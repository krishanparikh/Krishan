## _What is tennis?_
This is a page about my favorite sport: tennis
Note: I am a competitive tennis player and have not really played any other sports.
### _My history with the sport_
I also enjoy watching tennis. I purchase my tennis equipment from the site below.

- I have played tennis since I was young (4 years old).
- I have been to numerous tennis tournaments and competed in many of them as well. (Sidenote: I play against top 100 players in the USA for men's 18 and under)
- If I were to play another sport, I would play American football as I enjoy the fast paced environment.
- My current favorite tennis players are Gael Monfils, Frances Tiafoe, and Nick Kyrgios.

Tennis at school:
1. I am the Varsity Captain fo the WHS tennis team.
2. I helped the team make it to the CIF finals last year.




**Basic tennis rules:
1. Usually there are 2 players for singles matchplay, but for doubles there can be 4 players.
2. A single player starts the point with a _serve_.
3. To keep the point going the ball must land within the marked bounds. Hitting either the net or outside of the bounds results in losing the point.
4. Players are unabel to hit the ball more than once before it passes over the net.
5. Points go in these interval (0,15,30,40, deuce, and (sometimes) advantage).
6. Winning a "game" requires a player to win a point after 40. To win the set a player needs to make it to a totla of 6 games. If both players have 5 games (5-5) a tiebreak is played to 11 or sometimes 7 points.
7. Sportmanship is valued so cursing, hitting your raquet on the ground, or disrepsoecting your opponent may result in penalties.
